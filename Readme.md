### The VarCoVaR RiskMeter shows
* a better pronounced behaviour (than the old FRM version)
* the Pearson correlation between both time series: 0.966
* a clear visual correlation with the Lambda structure
* that market heights and lows are better captured
* a clear, concise statistical definition and derivation: conditional variance of CoVaR
* a clear economic interpretation: volatility of the (Co)VaR according to the covariates
* in contrast to the abstract Lambda index the VarCoVaR scale, which is the value domain of the (Co)VaR
* that the Lambda value domain does not start with zero: clear disadvantage in comparison with VarCoVaR. "No risk" should start with zero.
* a better spread between extreme values
* more stability over different companies but still different and individual characterizations
* the incorporation of the whole market volatility and not only Lambdas (based on Betas) from L1-Q-regression
* the financial crisis from 2008 much better pronunciated (peak value)
* also the volatility and uncertainty of the CoVaR of any given company/asset
* many interesting other features waiting for being analysed, investigated and evaluated...
